# Types of Contributions

## Report Bugs

Report bugs through [Issue-Template](#https://github.com/nsucheendran/thegame/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

Please report relevant information and preferably code that exhibits
the problem.


## Implement Features

Look through the [Feature-Implementation](#https://github.com/nsucheendran/thegame/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) for features.
Any unassigned "Improvement" issue is open to whoever wants to implement it.

We've created the operators, hooks, macros and executors we needed, but we
made sure that this part of Anguis is extensible. New operators,
hooks, macros and executors are very welcomed!

## Improve Documentation

AINGUS could always use better documentation,
whether as part of the official Anguis docs,
in docstrings, `docs/*.rst` or even on the web as blog posts or
articles.

## Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to open an issue on JIRA

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
