# Types of Contributions

## Report Bugs

Report bugs through [Issue-Template](https://github.com/nsucheendran/thegame/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

Please report relevant information and preferably code that exhibits
the problem.


## Implement Features

Look through the [Feature-Implementation](https://github.com/nsucheendran/thegame/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Feature_Request.md) for features.
Any unassigned "Improvement" issue is open to whoever wants to implement it.

We've created the operators, hooks, macros and executors we needed, but we
made sure that this part of Anguis is extensible. New operators,
hooks, macros and executors are very welcomed!

## Improve Documentation

Anguis could always use better documentation,
whether as part of the official Anguis docs,
in docstrings, `docs/*.rst` or even on the web as blog posts or
articles.
